Data management
===============

Documentation of the code in *src.data_management*.

Here you would include those steps which are only concerned with cleaning raw data, merging different data sets etc. In the case of the paper by Albouy, the raw data is adjusted according to the newly delivered additional data and then stored in *bld/out/data* so it may be re-used in the analysis section.
