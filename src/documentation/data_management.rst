Data management
===============

Documentation of the code in **data_management**.

 Draw simulated samples from two uncorrelated uniform variables
 (locations in two dimensions) for two types of agents and store
 them in a 3-dimensional matrix.

 *Note:* In principle, one would read the number of dimensions etc.
 from the "IN_MODEL_SPECS" file, this is to demonstrate the most basic
 use of *run_m_script* only.
