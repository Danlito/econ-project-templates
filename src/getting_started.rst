Getting started
***************

The basic steps are very easy:

    #. Clone the `econ-project-templates repository <https://github.com/hmgaudecker/econ-project-templates>`_ and switch to the branch named after the main language in your project.

      If you are not familiar with Git, you can use these links:

        * `Template for Python-based projects <https://github.com/hmgaudecker/econ-project-templates/archive/python.zip>`_
        * `Template for Matlab-based projects <https://github.com/hmgaudecker/econ-project-templates/archive/matlab.zip>`_
        * `Template for Stata-based projects <https://github.com/hmgaudecker/econ-project-templates/archive/stata.zip>`_
        * `Template for R-based projects <https://github.com/hmgaudecker/econ-project-templates/archive/R.zip>`_
      
      You can always check the examples from a different template if you want to mix languages.

    #. Follow the steps in the *README.md* file in the root directory of the project template that you downloaded. This will make sure that the basic setup is working on your machine.
    #. Move your programs to the right places (or create them there) and change the example *wscript*-files.


Feedback welcome!
=================

I have had a lot of feedback from former students who found this helpful. But in-class exposure to material is always different than reading up on it and I am sure that there are difficult-to-understand parts. I would love to hear about them! Please `drop me a line <mailto:hmgaudecker@gmail.com>`_ or, if you have concrete suggestions, `file an issue <https://github.com/hmgaudecker/econ-project-templates/issues>`_ on GitHub.
